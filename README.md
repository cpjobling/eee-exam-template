# A LaTeX template for typesetting exams 

`eee-exam-template` is a LaTeX template designed to facilitate typesetting
examinations for the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering
at Swansea University.

## Motivation

After struggling to get my exam papers to look right in Word, I have decided to go back to making my papers in LaTeX.

I have made a LaTeX template for EEE exams. You can see it on OverLeaf here: 
[eee-exam-template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tcgntgbgqrmaab) 
or you can clone it from GitHub [github.com/cpjobling/eee-exam-template](https://github.com/cpjobling/eee-exam-template).

It is based on the front page template that was distributed by the exams team earlier this year and makes use of the official LaTeX exam class
described in [Typesetting exams in LaTeX - Overleaf, Online LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Typesetting_exams_in_LaTeX).
